** 💡 Tip

Yeah, like you see that, it hasn't been updated for some years. Now (2022-10-10 23:00), I have tried to clone, run and fix it, 😹 But it's really so boring. Emm... anyway, hugo is also a good choice 😅 - [[https://github.com/loveminimal/hugo-theme-virgo][hugo-theme-virgo]]. 


** Preface

Hey, guys. To me, this theme is quite stable now, though it is simple, even has no tags and categories. But believe me, via the built-in search, you will have a better experence.

As a emacs user, I prefer =.org=. And that is why I make this theme, which can adapt to org-export better.

Hexo is an awesome generator, of course, I like it. Hmm.. but now I want to have a try on Hugo :) So this theme may be update slower. But if you have some questions in using it, let me know, and I am so glad to solve it with you together.

** Intro

Hmm.. :) It's a version 1.0.0. Here is a preview:

Note that: you must disable the =highlight= of site =_config.yml=, and update =theme= fragment as =zero=.

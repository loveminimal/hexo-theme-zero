Add local search feature, so you can have what you need.

** Note

I have merged branch dev to master :) Now, you can enjoy a simpler zero.

[[./preview/zero.png]]

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # cd your-blog
  git clone https://github.com/loveminimal/hexo-theme-zero.git ./themes/zero
#+END_SRC

Note that: you must disable the =highlight= of site =_config.yml=, like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  highlight:
    enable: false
    line_number: false
    auto_detect: false
    tab_replace:
#+END_EXAMPLE

and update =theme= fragment as =zero=.
